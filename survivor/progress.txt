WHERE I LEFT OFF

-users picks are loaded properly on init
-strikethrough toggling works properly, though we may want to limit picking both teams in a game
-all regions and rounds inputted
-all regions and rounds displayed except champion
-can swipe between regions


TODO
-need to style each round
-need to make sure can't pick both teams in a matchup
-need to make sure can't pick if you've lost
-need to put blank data in for rounds that haven't happened yet
-need to figure out server side
-need to figure out how to update data when rounds are happening
-need to lock games that have already happened (or games that day)
