WHERE I LEFT OFF
-multiple users exist, and load on init
-users picks are loaded properly on init
-strikethrough toggling works properly, though we may want to limit picking both teams in a game
-all regions and rounds inputed
-can swipe between rounds


TODO
-UPDATE NAVIGATION/NAVIGATOR (see lassie)
-maybe swipe vertically within a region (round of 64, 32, and 16)
-need to make sure can't pick if you've lost
-need to put blank data in for rounds that haven't happened yet
-need to figure out server side
-need to figure out how to update data when rounds are happening
-need to lock games that have already happened (or games that day) - check time on server, not device
-change user?
-admin role
-view all users picks
-filter by years
-NEED TO SIMULATE A TOURNAMENT by fixing date and going round by round and case by case
-#####1 need to change picks to keyed array of objects. key is team name. "togglePick" doesn't work well without it
-create "UserType" to pass around
-check out state for all rounds, is it necessary, etc. 
-move common functions to context
