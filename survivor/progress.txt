WHERE I LEFT OFF
-multiple users exist, and load on init
-users picks are loaded properly on init

-all regions and rounds inputed
-can swipe between rounds


TODO
-UPDATE NAVIGATION/NAVIGATOR (see lassie)
-maybe swipe vertically within a region (round of 64, 32, and 16)
-need to make sure can't pick if you've lost
-need to put blank data in for rounds that haven't happened yet
-need to figure out server side
-need to figure out how to update data when rounds are happening
-need to lock games that have already happened (or games that day) - check time on server, not device
